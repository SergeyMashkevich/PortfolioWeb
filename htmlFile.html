        My name is Sergey Mashkevich. <br />
        You are on my page: "about me," which I have created for a couple of reasons; one of them is because of my self-realization desire in this manner, and the other is just because it's cool to have your little platform like this. <br />
        What I do for the past: at the current time, I'm studying and using much time on my hobbies, and if the year isn't 2023 in now, then my routines aren't probably changed, where I go to the high school on the weekdays, have weekends on weekends. And in my free time, I self-developing my skills and like to learn new species of them. <br />
        I have written more about me on another page which has a link right below here. :)
