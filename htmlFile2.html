        I am a <span id="age"></span>-year-old IT enthusiast living in Denmark and previously studying at a high school named: Bagsværd Boarding School. After which I decided to pursue a military career because I considered it a more unconventional path, quite different from what I would have chosen if I had gone to university. I enlisted in the Danish Air Force, where I served from August 2023 to December of the same year, and where I acquired all the basic knowledge on how to handle combat situations and challenging circumstances, which led to a significant strengthening of my character. After that, I transitioned to a new phase of my service and began serving in the Danish Cyber Forces, where I'm serving in now. <br />  My background country is Russia, and in this regard, I know the Russian language very well. And at all, I speak three languages: Russian, Danish, and English. <br />
