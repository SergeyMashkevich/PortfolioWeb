        I am a 17-year-old IT enthusiast living in Denmark, and at this point studying at a high school named: Bagsværd Boarding School. My background country is Russia, and in this regard, I know the Russian language very well. At all, I speak three languages: Russian, Danish, and English. Even though I had studied the German language at ground school, I would not say that I would manage to speak that language along with my other known tongues. <br />
        Frequently, I spend my free time practicing calisthenics, running, playing the guitar, or learn and practice different types of programming languages.
